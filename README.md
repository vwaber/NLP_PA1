This application creates Unigram and Bigram, both MLE and Katz Back-off, language models from training data in the form of a text file of sentences delimited by newlines. These models are then used to generate sentences, evaluate the probability of these sentences, and to determine the perplexity of the language models over test data.

Created using Python 3.4. This application has only been tested on Windows 8.1 x64, but should run on any machine with Python 3.4
